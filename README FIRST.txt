There is one trailer and one of our showreel which are collaborations with NATFA (National Academy of Theather and Film Arts). 
As working as a cinematographer I have many video projects but I mainly use my showreels and trailers when looking for a new opportunity. 
I'm not a scriptwriter nor a songwriter, so excuse me if I'm a bit sideway from your task.
